# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio showcasing my skills, achievements, and coding journey. The project fetches and displays competitive programming ratings from various platforms and maintains a robust backend for data storage and updates.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built using React for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js to fetch and process rating distributions from popular competitive programming platforms via [Clist](https://clist.by/coder/manojkumar2412/).
- **Data Storage**:
  - **Firebase Firestore**: Used to back up the rating distributions.
  - **Relational Database (RDBMS)**: Maintains the titles of competitive programming platforms.
- **Data Generation (Datagen)**: Updates the rating distributions daily to ensure accuracy and freshness.

## Competitive Programming Platforms Integrated

- CodeChef
- CodeForces
- AtCoder
- LeetCode
